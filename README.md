# Final Work: Hope
This repository contains the final project for my last year of the Bachelor's program at Erasmushogeschool Brussel, Campus Kaai.
Hope is a 2D game about mental health, exploring topics such as depression and loneliness.
In Hope, players must interact with various elements in the environment to help the protagonist feel better, making the world brighter and more colorful.
Each interaction reflects a way to cope with depressionâ€”whether through social connection, meditation, productivity, or simply enjoying the little things in life.
Hope features a simple yet effective visual style that mirrors the protagonist's emotional state. The gradual change in background color and the shrinking vignette during certain interactions visually represent the character's emotional improvement.
